Data interpretation begins with statistical <a data-tooltip-large="">significance</a> and
understanding what it means in the context of your <a data-tooltip-large="">Campaign</a> Results.
Significance is the measurement of the likelihood that the observed
change in a [KPI](http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201118357-Key-Performance-Indicators-KPIs-) did not occur by random chance. Monetate reports
significance at three confidence levels: 90%, 95%, and 99%. The higher
the confidence, the less likely that a testâ€™s results occurred by
chance.

For example, if your test achieves 95% significance, Monetate estimates
that the difference between experiment and control is not due to random
variation in 95% of possible outcomes.

Monetate uses standard statistical models to test for differences
between experiment and <a data-tooltip-large="">control</a> groups. For mean-based metrics that
involve measuring the size of a quantity, Monetate uses a two-sided
t-test. For proportion-based metrics that involve measuring whether or
not a certain action has occurred (an order, leaving the site
immediately, etc.), Monetate uses the normal approximation to the
binomial distribution, also known as the Z-statistic.

Monetate recommends waiting at least two weeks with a minimum of at
least 100 conversions in both the experiment and the control before
trusting significance in your campaign because of the fluctuations in
data that may occur with smaller sample sizes. Confidence increases with
more data (and time) and with less variance.

**Note**: *Monetate reports significance for KPIs and not test
campaigns.*
