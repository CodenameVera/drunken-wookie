Data interpretation begins with statistical
<a data-tooltip-large="">significance</a>
and understanding what it means in the context of your
<a data-tooltip-large="">campaign</a>
results. Monetate reports significance at three
<a data-tooltip-large="">confidence</a>
levels: 90%, 95%, and 99%.

Monetate recommends waiting at least two weeks before
trusting significance in your campaigns because of the fluctuations in
data that may occur with smaller sample sizes. 

For more information on how Monetate measures and determines sample
size, please refer to the ["Determining Sample
Size](http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201586823-Determining-Sample-Size)"
documentation.

**Note**:* Monetate reports significance on the
[KPI](http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201118357)-level
rather than the campaign-level.*
