During the <a data-tooltip-large="">campaign</a> creation process, define goals in the **Why** part
of the Monetate sentence. The purpose of goal setting is to:

*  Select the [KPI](http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201118357-Key-Performance-Indicators-KPIs-) you want to optimize in the campaign.
*  Specify the <a data-tooltip-large="">confidence</a> level required (90%, 95%, 99%) to reach
    <a data-tooltip-large="">significance</a>.

 Monetate can notify you when each KPI reaches significance within the
campaign. If you’ve chosen to automatically push winning tests to 100%
of site traffic, Monetate will do so once:

*  The campaign reached the desired level of significance for one or more
    of the selected goals and metrics.
*  Your campaign goal has reached significance with positive or neutral
    results.
*  The campaign has no negative lift for any metric with statistical
    significance.

This is available for any testing campaign by clicking "Configure
auto-promotion" under the "Options" menu.

For more information, please refer to the "[Campaign
Auto-Promotion](http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201867183)"
documentation.

Within **Campaign Results**, you can view information about the
performance of individual metrics. Monetate reports significance for
each KPI within a campaign rather than at the “campaign level” itself.
Campaign-level significance offers little insight to marketers for some
metrics like "New Visitors" because the sample size for a campaign may
be larger than that of the KPI. By default, Campaign Results displays the cumulative
results of the campaign.

Every Monetate campaign contains visualizations of test performance that
include:

*  Statistical significance reported for all KPIs
*  Estimated time to significance for KPIs with less than 90% confidence

The "Actionable
Results" section of the visualization lists metrics that have reached confidence. The "Pending" section lists metrics that have not yet
reached confidence. For "Pending"
metrics, the time to reach confidence is also displayed.

***Note**: For all campaigns with splits, the control group is compared
with each individual split independently. For example, if you are
testing a campaign with three splits, one that tests a banner image, one
that tests a button, and one that tests a link, the control will be
compared against each individual split.*

Clicking any KPI will
display a line graph with a monthly breakdown of conversions for the
experiment and control in your campaign.

![Actionable
Results](https://s3.amazonaws.com/elearning.monetate.net/images/src/reporting_analytics_statistics/i14.png)

This graph is broken into three distinct parts: the shaded
non-confidence region, a dark blue experiment line, and a lighter blue
<a data-tooltip-large="">control</a> line. The non-confidence region is widest where there are the
fewest number of samples and the highest level of variance in the data.
If the experiment line is completely contained inside the gray
non-confidence region, the metric has not yet reached a confidence of
95%. When the experiment line breaks out of the non-confidence region
(either positively or negatively), the metric has reached at least 95%
confidence.
