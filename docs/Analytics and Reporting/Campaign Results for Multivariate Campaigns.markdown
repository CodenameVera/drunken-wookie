#Campaign Results: Multivariate Campaigns

###Viewing Campaign Results for Multivariate Campaigns

Within the **Campaign Results** screen, <a data-tooltip-large="">multivariate</a> campaigns are denoted by the multivariate icon.

There are two different views available for your multivariate campaign analytics: **Combinations** and **Actions**. You can switch between these views by clicking the dropdown (pictured below) and selecting an option.

The **Combinations** view shows the combinations that performed best (as compared to the control).

The following analytics are available for each combination (and the original) exclusively in the **Combinations** view:

* **Sessions**: The number of visitors that viewed a particular variant

The **Actions** view displays which actions on the page were most influential (positively or negatively) and which variant within that action performed the best.

 The following analytics are available for each combination (and the original) exclusively in the the Actions view: 

* **Relevance Rating**: Action Relevance, or the relevance rating, is a relative scale of the impact a given action has on the test as a whole. Each variant has an effect on the relevance rating; however, the rating is attributed only to the action.

Monetate reports the following items for both Action and Combination views: 

* **Estimated Range**: The range for each combination is its mean observed value plus or minus the confidence interval.

* **Chance to Beat Original**: The probability, expressed as a percentage, that a particular combination will be more successful than your original content.

* **Chance to Beat All**: The probability, expressed as a percentage, that a combination will be more successful than all other combinations running in the experiment. This number is typically lower than "Chance to Beat Original."

* **Observed Improvement**: The observed lift of a given combination over the original

* **Mean**: The mathematical average of the values observed for each combination

**Confidence Interval**: Range of values representing the confidence interval

**Confidence (Time to)**: The estimated amount of time the test must run to achieve a confidence of 95% for the evaluated combination and metric

**Note**: A multivariate campaign needs a significant amount of sessions and a reasonable amount of time to reach confidence that a variant is significant. Use the calculator available within a multivariate campaign to estimate the amount of time needed.

###Notes on Multivariate Reporting:

* Monetate supports ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) full factorial test design.

* Monetate's calculation of significance takes into account both tails of the distribution curve, capturing both positive and negative differentials from the mean of the original (referred to as two tailed significance). In the case of MVT, Monetate provides an additional layer of clarification around the positive differential in the metrics “Chance to beat original” and “Chance to beat all."

* For both Actions and Combinations, these reports are provided for all KPIs using the drop-down menu located in the top-right corner of the screen.
