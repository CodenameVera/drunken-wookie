###What is it?

An email acquisition lightbox is a custom <a data-tooltip-large="">action</a> that captures email
addresses and submits them to a form hosted on your servers. It does
this by converting specified clickzones on the creative to inputs and then submits
the email information when a user clicks a checkbox. Afterwards, this type
of lightbox often shows a "thank you" image.

###How do I set one up?

An email acquisition lightbox is a custom action built by Monetate.
Please contact Monetate for more information on how to have an email
acquisition lightbox built.

###What's required?

To implement an email acquisition lightbox, Monetate will need
the desired creatives (both for the lightbox and the thank you), the
inputs that you want to capture, and the link to the form you are
currently using to collect this data so that we can determine how to
submit. We also need to know if there are any other special
requirements, like validation.

###How is it built?

Once you provide the appropriate information, Monetate can build the
lightbox with either a submit through an iframe, or by making an AJAX
request to the client's server. Where possible, AJAX is the preferred
method for Lightbox creation.
