action.*

Styles
======

The “Styles” tab allows you to set the styling of an action. You can
specify the alignment, margins, and padding of your action. You can also
define these attributes in the CSS by clicking the “edit as raw CSS”
link. If the CSS changes in this step, it appends inline to the element
or the container.

**Note:** *Content Masking is important to allow certain actions to
function as expected. Any hide/show actions that you or your team create
should use Content Masking, especially if your site uses the synchronous
tag. For more information, please refer to the “\ `Content
Masking <http://support.monetate.com/hc/en-us/articles/201461016>`__\ ”
documentation.*

Conditions
===========

With the Conditions tab selected, you can define rules for when the
action should appear on your site based on the following parameters:

-  Page type
-  URL
-  Time
-  Cart Value
-  Landing Page
-  Page breadcrumb
-  Page category
-  On product page
-  On index page

You can add many conditions to an action for more specific targeting or
to only show under certain circumstances.

   <hr>

Inputs
=======

Within the “Inputs” tab, you can customize what parts of the action you
can change at the campaign level. This is an important step if you want
to make your action reusable.

In this example, you can change the image when adding the action to new
campaigns. You cannot change the element selector, placement, image
style, and image container styles.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/elearning.monetate.net/images/src/action_builder/i21.png
   :alt: ActionBuilder

   ActionBuilder

Keep in mind, the available inputs depend on the action type. Different
action types display different inputs that you can select to make the
action reusable in the future.

**Note:** *You can only edit inputs while the action is being built.
Once the action is created, you will not be able to change which inputs
are avaliable for editing in the future.*

Naming your Action
===================

Once you finish adjusting options within the action tabs, you will need
to give your action a unique name, description, category, and
subcategory. After you complete this step, click the “Create” button to
add your action to your Actions page for testing.
